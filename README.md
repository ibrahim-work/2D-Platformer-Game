# 2D-Platformer-Game
This 2D Platformer game is built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. It offers an engaging gaming experience where players control a dog character using arrow keys to run, jump, sit, and explore a world typically filled with obstacles, challenges, and platforms. The primary objective is to reach a goal or complete a level. While still under active development, the core gameplay is fully functional, allowing players to control the dog character with responsive movements.
